# Frame for the sensor. Latitude and longitude readings are at the origin of the frame.

# Latitude in degrees
float64 latitude

# Longitude in degrees
float64 longitude

# Altitude in meters

# Position covariance (m^2) defined relative to a tangential plane through the reported position. The components are East, North, and Up (ENU), in row-major order.
float64[9] position_covariance

# Unknown position covariance type
uint8 UNKNOWN=0

# Position covariance is approximated
uint8 APPROXIMATED=1

# Position covariance is per-axis, so put it along the diagonal
uint8 DIAGONAL_KNOWN=2

# Position covariance of the fix is known
uint8 KNOWN=3

# If `position_covariance` is available, `position_covariance_type` must be set to indicate the type of covariance.
