Each pair of output pixels is serialized as [U, Y1, V, Y2].\n  - `step` must be greater than or equal to `width` * 2.\n- `yuv422_yuy2` or  `yuyv`:\n  - Pixel colors are decomposed into [Y'UV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Y%E2%80%B2UV) channels.\n  - Pixel channel values are represented as unsigned 8-bit integers.\n  - U and V values are shared between horizontal pairs of pixels. Each pair of output pixels is encoded as [Y1, U, Y2, V].\n  - `step` must be greater than or equal to `width` * 2.\n- `rgb8`:\n  - Pixel colors are decomposed into Red, Green, and Blue channels.\n  - Pixel channel values are represented as unsigned 8-bit integers.\n  - Each output pixel is serialized as [R, G, B].\n  - `step` must be greater than or equal to `width` * 3.\n- `rgba8`:\n  - Pixel colors are decomposed into Red, Green, Blue, and Alpha channels.\n  - Pixel channel values are represented as unsigned 8-bit integers.\n  - Each output pixel is serialized as [R, G, B, Alpha].\n  - `step` must be greater than or equal to `width` * 4.\n- `bgr8` or `8UC3`:\n  - Pixel colors are decomposed into Blue, Green, and Red channels.\n  - Pixel channel values are represented as unsigned 8-bit integers.\n  - Each output pixel is serialized as [B, G, R].\n  - `step` must be greater than or equal to `width` * 3.\n- `bgra8`:\n  - Pixel colors are decomposed into Blue, Green, Red, and Alpha channels.\n  - Pixel channel values are represented as unsigned 8-bit integers.\n  - Each output pixel is encoded as [B, G, R, Alpha].\n  - `step` must be greater than or equal to `width` * 4.\n- `32FC1`:\n  - Pixel brightness is represented as a single-channel, 32-bit little-endian IEEE 754 floating-point value, ranging from 0.0 (black) to 1.0 (white).\n  - `step` must be greater than or equal to `width` * 4.\n- `bayer_rggb8`, `bayer_bggr8`, `bayer_gbrg8`, or `bayer_grbg8`:\n  - Pixel colors are decomposed into Red, Blue and Green channels.\n  - Pixel channel values are represented as unsigned 8-bit integers, and serialized in a 2x2 bayer filter pattern.\n  - The order of the four letters after `bayer_` determine the layout, so for `bayer_wxyz8` the pattern is:\n  ```plaintext\n  w | x\n  - + -\n  y | z\n  ```\n  - `step` must be greater than or equal to `width`.\n- `mono8` or `8UC1`:\n  - Pixel brightness is represented as unsigned 8-bit integers.\n  - `step` must be greater than or equal to `width`.\n- `mono16` or `16UC1`:\n  - Pixel brightness is represented as 16-bit unsigned little-endian integers.
