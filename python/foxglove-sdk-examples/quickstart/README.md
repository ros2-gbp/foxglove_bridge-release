# Foxglove SDK Quickstart

An example from the Foxglove SDK.

This demonstrates logging messages to an MCAP file and to a running instance of the Foxglove app. It
creates a new file named "quickstart-python.mcap" and errors if the file already exists.

## Usage

This example uses Poetry: https://python-poetry.org/

```bash
poetry install
poetry run python main.py
```
