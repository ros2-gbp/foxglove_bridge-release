# Streaming a Luxonis OAK camera to Foxglove

This tutorial shows how to take a [Luxonis OAK](https://docs.luxonis.com/) depth camera and stream camera, point cloud, and IMU data live into [Foxglove](https://foxglove.dev) using the Foxglove SDK:

| Topic | Schema | Contents |
|-------|--------|----------|
| `/oak/points` | `foxglove.PointCloud` | Colored point cloud in meters |
| `/oak/rgb/image` | `foxglove.RawImage` | Raw color video (`bgr8`) |
| `/oak/rgb/calibration` | `foxglove.CameraCalibration` | Color-camera intrinsics + distortion |
| `/oak/imu` | JSON (`sensor_msgs`-like) | Accelerometer (m/s²) + gyroscope (rad/s) |
| `/tf` | `foxglove.FrameTransforms` | One static transform that orients the camera frame upright |

Everything runs in a single Python script ([`main.py`](./main.py)) with no ROS required: the camera does the heavy lifting (stereo matching runs on the device), and the Foxglove SDK serves the results over a WebSocket that the Foxglove app connects to directly.

## Prerequisites

- A Luxonis OAK camera with stereo depth and an IMU (tested with the [OAK-4 D](https://docs.luxonis.com/hardware/products/OAK%204%20D%20Pro)) connected over USB 3 or Ethernet.
- Linux with the Luxonis [udev rules](https://docs.luxonis.com/hardware/platform/deploy/usb-deployment-guide/) installed (for USB devices).
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) to run the example. The dependencies — [`foxglove-sdk`](https://pypi.org/project/foxglove-sdk/) and [DepthAI v3](https://docs.luxonis.com/software-v3/) — are declared in `pyproject.toml` and installed automatically.

## Run it

```bash
cd python/foxglove-sdk-examples/oak-camera-streaming
uv run python main.py
```

Then open [Foxglove](https://app.foxglove.dev), choose **Open connection…**, and connect to `ws://localhost:8765` (the script also prints a direct link at startup).

Add these panels (or use the layout at `foxglove/oak_layout.json` via **Import from file…**):

- **Image** → topic `/oak/rgb/image`, **Calibration** `/oak/rgb/calibration` — the live color feed, undistorted using the device's factory intrinsics.
- **3D** → set the panel's **display frame** to `oak`, enable `/oak/points`, and optionally enable `/oak/rgb/calibration` under **Camera field-of-view** to see the camera frustum.
- **Plot** → message path `/oak/imu.linear_acceleration.x` (or any other axis) — IMU readings over time.

Useful flags:

```bash
uv run python main.py --depth-source stereo
uv run python main.py --depth-source neural
uv run python main.py --port 8765
uv run python main.py --record oak.mcap
uv run python main.py --point-unit auto
```

`--point-unit auto` is the default. It detects whether DepthAI point coordinates are meter-scale or millimeter-scale before publishing Foxglove point clouds in meters.

## How it works

The script follows three steps, in the same order as the code.

### 1. Create a Foxglove channel per stream

The Foxglove SDK ships typed channels for its [well-known schemas](https://docs.foxglove.dev/docs/sdk/schemas) — images, calibration, transforms — which the Foxglove app knows how to visualize out of the box:

```python
points_channel = PointCloudChannel(topic="/oak/points")
rgb_channel = RawImageChannel(topic="/oak/rgb/image")
cal_channel = CameraCalibrationChannel(topic="/oak/rgb/calibration")
tf_channel = FrameTransformsChannel(topic="/tf")
```

The IMU has no dedicated Foxglove schema, so it uses a generic JSON channel. Shaping the payload like ROS `sensor_msgs/Imu` (`linear_acceleration`, `angular_velocity`, a stamped header) keeps it compatible with the Plot panel and familiar to ROS users:

```python
imu_channel = Channel(topic="/oak/imu", message_encoding="json", schema=...)
```

Starting the server is one line — every message logged to a channel after this is broadcast to all connected Foxglove clients:

```python
server = foxglove.start_server()
```

### 2. Build the DepthAI pipeline

DepthAI v3 describes the on-device processing as a graph of nodes:

```text
CAM_A (color) ──────┐        ┌──► host → /oak/points
                    ├─► RGBD ┤
CAM_B/C (depth) ────┘        └──► host → /oak/rgb/image
IMU ─────────────────────────────► host → /oak/imu
```

- The **color camera** outputs frames for `/oak/rgb/image` and provides RGB color for the `RGBD` point cloud.
- The **depth source** is either stereo depth or neural depth. It feeds the `RGBD` node, which publishes colored point cloud packets.
- The **IMU** node batches samples on the device (`setBatchReportThreshold`) so the host isn't flooded with one tiny packet per sample at 50 Hz.
- The **calibration** is read once from the device (`device.readCalibration()`) and republished as a `foxglove.CameraCalibration` on every RGB frame. Foxglove uses it to draw the camera frustum and undistort the live image in the Image panel.

### 3. Convert packets to Foxglove messages

The main loop polls each output queue with the non-blocking `tryGet()`, so one loop services all streams at their own natural rates. Each DepthAI packet maps to one Foxglove message:

- A color `ImgFrame` becomes a `RawImage`: width, height, `bgr8` encoding, row stride, and the pixel buffer. Each frame also re-stamps and publishes the cached `CameraCalibration` so MCAP playback always finds a recent one nearby.
- A `PointCloudData` packet becomes a `PointCloud`: XYZ float32 fields in meters plus red, green, blue, and alpha uint8 fields.
- Each IMU packet becomes one JSON message with the accelerometer and gyroscope vectors.

Every message carries the DepthAI monotonic timestamp converted to a Unix-epoch Foxglove `Timestamp`, so all streams stay mutually synchronized in live viewing and MCAP playback.

### Coordinate frames

Camera data lives in an *optical* frame (Z forward, X right, Y down), while Foxglove's 3D scene is Z-up. The RGB image, point cloud, and calibration all share CAM_A's optical frame, which we stamp as `frame_id="oak_optical"`. The script publishes a single static `FrameTransform` from `oak` (X forward, Z up) to `oak_optical` using the standard ROS optical rotation. Setting the 3D panel's display frame to `oak` is then enough to see the scene upright. A real robot would extend this transform tree — e.g. publishing `base_link → oak` from its own state — without touching the camera code.

### Distortion-model mapping

Foxglove supports a fixed set of distortion models. DepthAI's `Perspective` is OpenCV's 14-parameter rational polynomial; we map it to Foxglove's `rational_polynomial` and keep the first 8 coefficients (`k1..k6, p1, p2`). DepthAI's `Fisheye` maps to Foxglove's `kannala_brandt` with 4 coefficients. Any other DepthAI model is published with `distortion_model=""` and `D=[]`, so Foxglove falls back to using just the pinhole matrix `K` — the frustum and the colored point cloud still work, only the per-pixel undistortion is skipped.

## Going further

- For remote viewing, see the [`remote-access`](../remote-access) example — the SDK can transcode video inline for you. On-device encoding (`dai.node.VideoEncoder` → `foxglove.CompressedVideo`) is another option if you want to cut bandwidth before the host.
- See the [Foxglove SDK docs](https://docs.foxglove.dev/docs/sdk/introduction) and [DepthAI v3 examples](https://docs.luxonis.com/software-v3/depthai/examples/) for both halves of the integration.

**Note:** the repo's `yarn run-python-sdk-examples` CI script skips this folder because it requires a physical OAK camera.
